## About

Blockifier is a rust implementation for the component in the Starknet sequencer in charge of creating states and blocks.

## Roadmap
| name                   | status |
|------------------------|:--------:|
| Integrate with the existing Starknet Sequencer by replacing its current Blockifier, which is written in Python             | ⏳ |
| Extend the Blockifier into a full Starknet sequencer, written in Rust, replacing the one currently in use in Starknet      |    |
