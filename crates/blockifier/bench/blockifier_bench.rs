//! Benchmark module for the blockifier crate. It provides functionalities to benchmark
//! various aspects related to transferring between accounts, including preparation
//! and execution of transfers.
//!
//! The main benchmark function is `transfers_benchmark`, which measures the performance
//! of transfers between randomly created accounts, which are iterated over round-robin.
//!
//! Run the benchmarks using `cargo bench --bench blockifier_bench`.
